This was my first real project combining everything that I had learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a little bit of PHP mixed in.  The site is currently deployed using AWS's S3.  Some plug-ins were used to fill in the gaps of what I did not know at the time.  What resulted is a static site containing a mixture of information from my resume and portfolio in one convenient location; thus, a portsume (portfolio/resume) was born!

If you visit www.pjsportsume.com, you can see the fruits of my labor!  Be sure to check back periodically as my portsume will be updated, rebuilt using the MEAN stack, and migrated to AWS's EC2 service by the end of February 2017.

Thanks for visiting!
